(Description supplied with photograph) Auctioneers: Barnes & Co. Ltd., Roma St., Brisbane. Surveyors: R.A. Hamilton & James, 171 Queen Street. Brookfield, regarded as one of Brisbane's later developing suburbs, actually was one of the earliest areas settled. The fertile country in the district was farmed as early as 1850 with dairying and small crops being the main occupation. By the early 1870s population growth warranted the establishment of the first primary school in the area. Timber getting was also an early industry and there are the remains of a number of old gold mines in the district. Brookfield remained a quiet farming community until recent years when it became one of Brisbane's 'Green Belt' suburbs with larger housing blocks preserving the pleasant bush setting. Brookfield was named by either Mrs L. Logan, an early resident, because of the abundance of meadows, creeks and gullies, or by Mrs Lucinda Brimblecombe in 1868 at a residents' meeting to give the district a name. Mrs Brimblecombe is reported to have suggested that since the area had so many flowing brooks the district should be called Brookfield.

Indooroopilly is a leafy riverside suburb in Brisbane's west and derives its name from either the Aboriginal term for running water or gully of leeches. The suburb was first settled in 1860 when Mr H C Rawnsley purchased land south of Witton Creek and in 1861 built the first house in the area, named Witton Manor, on the site of the present Nudgee Junior College. Development was slow until 1875 when a rail service was provided from Brisbane, after which houses and firms soon sprang up. In 1876 the first railway bridge was built. This was swept away in the disastrous 1893 flood, but was rebuilt. The Walter Taylor Bridge (commonly known as the Indooroopilly Toll Bridge) was built in 1936 and linked Indooroopilly to Chelmer.
